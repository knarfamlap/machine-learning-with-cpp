# Machine Learning With Python and C++ :computer:

Examples that demostrates how to implement classic machine learning algorithms from scratch. 

## Motivation :running: 

Sklearn doesn't provide sufficient exposure to the implementation of algorithms in machine learning. For that reason, I decided to take up the challenge to implement them myself with Python and C++.

Additionally, I hope to write a guide on how to do the implementation yourself so you can have a better grasp of whats happening under the hood. I am thinking of writting the guides in Medium. 


## Goals :soccer:
The goal is to implement the following: 

- [X] Linear Regression
    - [ ] Python
    - [X] C++
- [ ] Logistic Regression
    - [ ] Python
    - [ ] C++ 
- [ ] Random Forest
    - [ ] Python
    - [ ] C++
- [ ] K Nearest Neighbors
    - [ ] Python
    - [ ] C++
