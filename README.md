# Machine Learning With Python and C++ :computer:

Examples that demostrates how to implement classic machine learning algorithms from scratch. 

## Motivation :running: 

TBH
<!-- Sklearn doesn't provide sufficient exposure to the implementation of algorithms in machine learning. For that reason, I decided to take up the challenge to implement them myself with Python and C++. -->

<!-- Additionally, I hope to write a guide on how to do the implementation yourself so you can have a better grasp of whats happening under the hood. I am thinking of writting the guides in Medium.  -->


## Goals :soccer:
The goal is to implement the following: 

- [X] Linear Regression ([Python](/linear_models/linear-regression/python/linear_regression.ipynb)/C++)
- [X] Logistic Regression ([Python](/linear_models/logistic-regression/python/logistic_regression.ipynb)/[C++]())
- [X] Gaussian Discriminant Analysis - GDA ([Python](/linear_models/gda/python/gda.ipynb)/[C++]())
- [x] Naive Bayes ([Python](/linear_models/naive-bayes/python/naive-bayes.ipynb)/[C++]())
- [X] Support Vector Machines(SVM) ([Python](/linear_models/svm/svm.ipynb)/C++)
- [ ] Random Forest
- [ ] K Nearest Neighbors
