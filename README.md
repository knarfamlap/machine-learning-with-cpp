# Machine Learning With C++ :computer:

Examples that demostrates how to implement classic machine learning algorithms. 

## Motivation :running: 
Using Python with Sklearn and Numpy did not provide sufficient exposure to the implementation of machine learning algorithms. For that reason, I decided to take up the challenge to implement them myself with C++. 

Additionally, I hope to write a guide on how to do the implementation yourself so you can have a better grasp of whats happening under the hood. I am thinking of writting the guides in Medium. 


## Goals :soccer:
The goal is to implement the following: 

- [X] Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Random Forest
- [ ] K Nearest Neighbors
